# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
In this project, I performed an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL to uncover meaningful insights from the dataset. My responsibilities included querying large datasets, cleaning data, and transforming raw information into structured and insightful reports. I utilized various SQL techniques, such as filtering, aggregation, joining multiple tables, and creating subqueries, to analyze patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. The insights obtained helped in understanding the key metrics, uncovering data distributions, and identifying potential areas for improvement or further analysis.

Key Highlights:

Data filtering, aggregation, and summarization using SQL queries.
Deep analysis of key trends and data distributions.
Data cleaning and transformation to ensure accuracy and consistency in the analysis.
